# Releasing

This project publishes release tags to Maven Central through GitHub Actions and
the Sonatype Central Publisher Portal.

Artifact page:
https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.youngledo/jpackage-maven-plugin

## Versioning

- Use semantic versioning after the first public release.
- Use `0.x` while the configuration model can still change.
- Keep snapshots on the main development branch.
- Tag releases as `v<version>`, for example `v0.1.0`.

## Pre-release Checks

Run the plugin build:

```bash
sdk env
./mvnw verify
```

Run at least one host packaging smoke test before publishing:

```bash
./mvnw install
./mvnw -f samples/classpath-swing/pom.xml package
```

Before a stable release, verify the sample projects on the target operating
systems:

| Host | Expected package types |
|---|---|
| macOS | `app-image`, `dmg`, `pkg` |
| Linux | `app-image`, `deb`, `rpm` |
| Windows | `app-image`, `msi`, `exe` |

## GitHub Secrets

Configure these repository secrets before pushing a release tag:

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CENTRAL_USERNAME` | Sonatype Central Portal user token username. |
| `CENTRAL_TOKEN` | Sonatype Central Portal user token password/token. |
| `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` | ASCII-armored private key used to sign release artifacts. |
| `GPG_PASSPHRASE` | Passphrase for `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`. |

## Publishing

Release publishing is triggered by tags matching `v*`. The workflow validates
that the tag and `project.version` match and refuses to publish `-SNAPSHOT`
versions.

Example release:

```bash
./mvnw versions:set -DnewVersion=0.1.0
./mvnw verify
git commit -am "release: prepare 0.1.0"
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin main v0.1.0
```

The publish job runs:

```bash
./mvnw -B -P release -DskipTests install \
  org.sonatype.central:central-publishing-maven-plugin:0.10.0:publish \
  -DautoPublish=true \
  -Dmaven.consumer.pom.flatten=false
```

The `release` Maven profile attaches sources, attaches Javadocs, signs
artifacts with GPG, uploads the deployment to the Central Portal, and auto
publishes after validation.

Before running the Maven publish command, the GitHub workflow temporarily
rewrites `pom.xml` to Maven model `4.0.0` so Sonatype Central can associate the
uploaded files with Maven coordinates. The committed source POM remains Maven
`4.1.0`.

After the publish job succeeds, a second workflow job checks out `main`, bumps
the root project version to the next patch snapshot, commits it, and pushes it
back to `main`. For example, publishing `v0.1.0` bumps `main` to
`0.1.1-SNAPSHOT`.

GitHub Packages can be added later as a secondary distribution target for
snapshots or early access builds.

## Release Notes

Update `CHANGELOG.md` before tagging a release.

Release notes should include:

- Breaking configuration changes.
- New `jpackage`, `jlink`, or Leyden options.
- Host operating systems that were verified.
- Known limitations.
